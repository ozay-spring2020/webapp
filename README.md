About the field data types in swagger docs:

If a field has readOnly set to true, the value in this field is populated by your application. Example field are timestamp and id. readOnly properties are included in responses but not in requests.
If a field has writeOnly set to true, the value in this field is provided by API caller in POST or PUT request but these fields are not part of GET request. Example is password field. writeOnly properties may be sent in requests but not in responses.
multipleOf keyword is used to specify that a number must be the multiple of another number.
The minimum and maximum keywords are used to specify the range of possible values.
